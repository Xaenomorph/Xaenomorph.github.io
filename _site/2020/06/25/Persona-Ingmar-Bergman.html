<h2>Persona: A Psychotic Nightmare</h2>

<p>25 Jun 2020 - </p>


<p>Persona is a 1966 Swedish psychological drama film,[n 1] written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann. The story revolves around a young nurse named Alma (Andersson) and her patient, well-known stage actress Elisabet Vogler (Ullmann), who has suddenly stopped speaking. They move to a cottage, where Alma cares for Elisabet, confides in her and begins having trouble distinguishing herself from her patient.</p>

<p>Characterized by elements of psychological horror, Persona has been the subject of much critical analysis, interpretation and debate. The film&#8217;s exploration of duality, insanity and personal identity has been interpreted as reflecting the Jungian theory of persona and dealing with issues related to filmmaking, vampire mythology, lesbianism, motherhood, abortion and other subjects. The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also been noted. The enigmatic film has been called the Mount Everest of cinematic analysis; according to film historian Peter Cowie, &#8220;Everything one says about Persona may be contradicted; the opposite will also be true&#8221;.[n 2]</p>
