            <p>Howdy fellow traveler, and welcome to my humble abode!
                <p>Uhm, so...I have literally no idea how you ended up visiting this website...
                    <p>Clicking on random links on the Internet isn't the safest thing to do while you try to deal with boredom, right?
                    <p>As we usually tend to say, curiosity killed the cat. 
                        <p>Therefore, don't be a cat. Really.
                    <p>Too bad you just clicked on that link anyway, and now you're here, clueless of what is happening.
                <p><i>so, y'know...</i>
                    <br>
                <h3>Let me introduce myself a little</h3>
                <br>
                <p>My name is <b>Angelo</b>. 
                <p>I'm an Italian guy keen on <b>learning</b> new things everyday.
                <p>It would be pretty accurate to describe me as a <b>tech enthusiast</b>, someone interested in the art of <b>software development</b> and other bullshit like that.
                <p>Needless to say that I'm pretty much a filthy <b>newb</b>, but I try to improve day after day. 
                <p>My experience in this sector revolves mainly around C and Py practice sessions, other than aimless attempts at coding random static HTML pages.
                <p>This very website is a semi-failed experiment of design and web developing as a whole! Yay!
                <p>I've recently converted it to Jekyll in order to manage posts and the blog page itself in a "comfortable" way.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>While chasing the feeble and vain hope of basing my future job on this stuff I do as a mere hobby, I cultivate several other passions,
                <p>ranging from reading (mainly sci-fi/cyberpunk novels and mythology books), writing and working out, 
                <p>to cinematography (my favorite directors being Lynch, Von Trier, Polanski, P.T. Anderson and Bergman), 
                <p>music (basically obsessed with Crystal Castles, Radiohead, Slowdive and Aphex Twin), videogames and even art.
                <p>It may sound cringy and cocky, but I consider myself to be an aesthete, 
                <p>a cultist of beauty, constantly bewitched by visually pleasing things surrounding me,
                <p>while being driven mostly by admiration but also envy towards those very things.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>This site is nothing more than a collection of ramblings and thoughts.</h3>
                    <h3>something that keeps slowly evolving with time.</h3>
                    <h3>something that I want to make my unique, comfy little place.</h3>
                    <br><br>
                <p>You're free to explore, but keep in mind that some pages may still not be fully functional.
                <p>That said, see you around.
