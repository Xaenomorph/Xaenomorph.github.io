As the title says, we're dealing with the japanese artist Takato Yamamoto, one of the exponents of the ero-guro movement, and a really good one at that too. No need to say that he's probably one of my favorite contemporary artists.

With "ero-guro" (abbreviation of ero-guro nanensu) we describe a specific artistic/illustrative genre focusing on a bond of eroticism and grotesque imaginery. 

Although this category may describe his works in a quite accurate way, Yamamoto adopts the expression "Heisei estheticism", title coined by himself in order to refer to the Aesthetic movement, based on "art's for art's sake", while focusing on the Heisei period of Japanese history.

Yamamoto is a contemporary painter who was born in the Akita prefecture in 1960. He studied at Tokyo Zokei University, a private university in Hachiouji, and graduated from the painting department. His style seems to be originally linked to the interest he had for the Ukiyo-e art genre, which originates during the first half of 1700. 

He managed to transform it in something peculiar and deeply personal blending it with Western gothic art, giving to life a twisted and stunning artstyle that mainly revolves around sensuality, decadence, eroticism, death and violence, everything perfectly permeated by a thin layer of delicacy and staticity.
